## What does this app do?

1. Predicting car's efficiency
2. How many miles per gallon the car runs?
3. This can be predicted from car's Weight, Transmission type and hp
4. Uses historical data to build a regression model to learn and predict

__A note for car buyer: Know car's efficiency before deciding to buy__

## Using historical data to build a model

Using _mtcars_ data and only wt, hp and am columns

```{r}

head( mtcars[ ,c( "mpg", "wt", "hp", "am")] )

```

--- .class #id 

## Exploring relationships 

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.height= 6,fig.width=14}

library( gridExtra )

wtp <- ggplot( data = mtcars, aes( x = wt, y = mpg, color = am) ) + 
        geom_point( share = 1) +
        ggtitle("mpg vs. wt for different transmisstion types")

hpp <- ggplot( data = mtcars, aes( x = hp, y = mpg, color = am) ) + 
        geom_point( share = 1) +
        ggtitle("mpg vs. hp for different transmisstion types")
grid.arrange( wtp, hpp, ncol = 2)

```

From the plots, mpg seems to be negatively correlated with wt and hp. Also, manual transmission have higher mpg compared to automatic transmission types.

## Building the regression model 

```{r}
fit1 <- lm( mpg ~ wt + hp + am, data = mtcars )
summary( fit1 )$coefficients
```
__Notes:__

From p-values, it is apparent that all the predictors are significant.

Adjdusted r square value indicates that the equation can explain ```r summary( fit1 )$adj.r.squared * 100 ```% of the total variations in the mpg for different cars.
